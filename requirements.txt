# WakeSync Project - Node.js Dependencies
This project uses Node.js and its package manager (npm or Yarn) to manage dependencies.
The list of all frontend and backend dependencies, along with their versions,
can be found in the `package.json` file in the project root directory and in the `backend/package.json` file respectively.

To install all necessary dependencies for the frontend, navigate to the project root directory and run:
npm install
# or
yarn install

To install dependencies for the backend, navigate to the `backend/` directory and run:
cd backend
npm install
# or
yarn install

There is no traditional `requirements.txt` file as used in Python projects.
The `package.json` and `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock`) files serve this purpose.
